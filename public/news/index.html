            <p>Despite his ruthless and somewhat black and white nature, General Zod has proved to be the single greatest leader
                of the entire planet. Crime has become virtually non existent, due to fear of Zod himself, falling by approximately 99.99%.
                According to a representative of the Great General Zod, the Batman is allegedly responsible for the remaining 0.01% of crime.
                As always seems to be the case, Batman remains at large.
